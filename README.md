Summary of Project - For this project, I implemented Conway's classic game of life simulation in a java application

The project is divided up into three files - The Main.Java, the Cell.java and the Stage.java.

	Main - The Main.java is the driver of the program...handling the run conditions and the primary rendering.
	
	Stage - The Stage.java handles the display and "alive" conditions regarding each individual cell.
	
	Cell - Cell.java contains information regarding each indivdual cell - its health status, size, and position.
